#### Sandbox project to test different technologies and to implement one old idea of a zero-playing game.


## Description
Game mechanic would allow players to write their own AI algorithms for simple battle units (tanks). Each algorithm will
 be made of pre-defined blocks and player won't be able to change any other parameters.
